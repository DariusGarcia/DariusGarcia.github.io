                    I am a 4th-year Business Economics student at UC Irvine. I am a self-starter that is<br></br> 
                    aspiring to leverage my Business Economic 
                    analytical skills to break into a career in tech!

                <p className='about-me-message'>
                    More specifically, 
                    I'm interested in becoming a front-end web developer because I <br></br>
                    started to enjoy making mobile android apps after I took a course on mobile app <br></br>
                    development 
                    here at UC Irvine through a nonprofit organization called CodePath Org.<br></br>
                    Since then I have found a love for creating elegant apps and decided to start learning<br></br>
                     other
                    programming languages to be able to explore my creativity.

                <p className='about-me-message'>
                    I have a passion for learning new things to apply to my everyday life
                    because <br></br>
                    I am a film believer that knowledge is power. I am a problem solver, passionate<br></br>  about uncovering the "why" in how things work, and want to make 
                    the world a<br></br> better place for all!
