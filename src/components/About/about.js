                <p className='about-me-message'>
                    I am a senior Business Economics student at UC Irvine. I am a self-starter that is
                    driven to uncover the "why" in how things work. 
                </p>
                <p className='about-me-message'>
                    More specifically, 
                    I'm interested in becoming a front-end web developer because I found a passion for programming after taking a course 
                    in native mobile Android app development here at UC Irvine through a nonprofit organization called CodePath Org. I fell in 
                    love with having to think outside the box for solving various problems and being able to let my creativity run freely.
                    Since then, I have found a love for creating elegant apps to which I decided to push myself to start learning other
                    programming languages and technologies to further increase my capabilities and to see where my creativity takes me.  
                </p> 
                <p className='about-me-message'>
                    I strive to learn new things to apply to my everyday life
                    because 
                    I am a film believer that knowledge is power. I am a problem solver that wants to use my skills to help other people and to be able to make 
                    the world a better place for all!
