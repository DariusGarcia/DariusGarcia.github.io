                    I am a 4th-year Business Economics student at UC Irvine. I am a self-starter that is
                    aspiring to leverage my Business Economic 
                    analytical skills to break into a career in tech!

                    More specifically, 
                    I'm interested in becoming a front-end web developer because I 
                    started to enjoy making mobile android apps after I took a course on mobile app 
                    development here at UC Irvine through a nonprofit organization called CodePath Org.
                    Since then I have found a love for creating elegant apps and decided to start learning other
                    programming languages to be able to explore my creativity.

                    I have a passion for learning new things to apply to my everyday life
                    because 
                    I am a film believer that knowledge is power. I am a problem solver, passionate  about uncovering the "why" in how things work, and want to make 
                    the world a better place for all!
